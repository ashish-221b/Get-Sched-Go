The key idea of project is to make an interactive  web application which is a daily, weekly and monthly scheduler .
Based on your input events it will generate few suitable timetables. 
Your input events can be specified daily/weekly/ monthly and also with your preference. 
You can also fix the time of event or keep it flexible for which our scheduler will generate a few possible timings keeping in mind upon the fixed events whose timings are pre-specified(e.g. Lectures , quizzes have max preference with fixed timing. Assignments have max preference with a flexible timing. 
Playing games has a low priority with flexible timing and attending a insti-event have low priority but fixed timing).  
We would also take care of events that has a time interval(e.g. lunch timing of yours). 
It's next step is to maintain specific profiling of individual such as sleep-time(sparsed or continuous), working time preference(e.g. late night or early morning), continous working durations. 
Suggesting adequate sleep timing after a tiring days and before an important day.
Further level would be interaction between users (e.g. An instructor pushing an extra class, team-leader of ssl deciding time to meet).
Sharing of schedule would help instructor decide proper timings but the detail of schedule sharing depends on choice of user. Though the priority of schedule would be visible.
We will use python with django in backend to generate and maintain the schedule and in frontend use html with css and js. 
Our output would be a timetable which can also be exported as a csv file to your google calender etc. The thing we are tring to deliver to our user is an easy way of time management, a thing which lacks amongst us.
