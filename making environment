Firstly install pyhton3-pip

sudo pip3 install virtualenv

NOT NEEDED IF THERE IS ALREADY AN ENVIRONMENT
virtualenv getSchedGo

NOW
cd getSchedGo
source bin/activate

Afterwards expected that all requirement seperate installation not needed.

But observed that even after installing packages the packages though get passed to next PC while pulling but essentially never get used and don't show up in pip list so please maintain requirement.txt 


Still we will maintain requirement.txt in the getSchedGo environment folder
