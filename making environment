Firstly install pyhton3-pip

sudo pip3 install virtualenv

NOT NEEDED IF THERE IS ALREADY AN ENVIRONMENT
virtualenv getSchedGo

NOW
cd getSchedGo
source bin/activate

Afterwards expected that all requirement seperate installation not needed.
Still we will maintain requirement.txt in the getSchedGo environment folder
